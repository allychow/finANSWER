# We have all your financial answers. (NOTE: intended as a pun - "financer")

At HackWestern4 we built this web app focused on two things. We wanted to use machine learning to make budgeting personalized and effective, and we wanted to be able to "split the bill" integrated with all platforms. We built a basic money tracker, as well as the front end frame to have a tracking of your balances with different friends. We focused these pages on the visual representations of balances, so that at a glance you can see exactly how much your friends owe you (and hopefully how little you owe your friends). We created a sample integration with the Weather Network API, as well as a messenger bot to send bills to friends, and the functionality to upload and analyze the image of a receipt for easy additions to our transaction list.
